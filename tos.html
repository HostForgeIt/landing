        <h2>9. Content</h2>
            <p>Under no circumstances are you permitted to submit information to HostForge that is illegal to display, distribute, or disseminate in the United States. In addition to this, HostForge does not host:</p>
                <h3>9.1. Unsubstantiated insults, hate or rumours against a person or group of people</h3>
                    <p>Content on wikis must be fairly balanced, meaningful or substantiated by independent referencing. Wikis which have a clearly identifiable comedic or satire value are exempt from needing to 
                        substantiate claims as these provide a meaningful value in terms of relevant content. Exceptions for comedy/satire do not cover derogatory language based on factors such as race, ethnicity, 
                        gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, disability, or other marginalized groups.</p>
                <h3>9.2. Communities characterised as toxic</h3>
                    <p>This may include wikis where there have been repeated personal attacks, harassment of users, 'doxing', hate speech and where local administrators have ignored, enabled, and/or done little to stop this.</p>
                <h3>9.3. Lascivious content involving minors</h3>
                    <p>Whether content is of a sexual nature and whether it involves minors will be determined by reference to all the circumstances and descriptions. Content includes written content, real images and animated or 
                        fictional images. Where a wiki's scope as a whole is not of a sexual nature which involves minors, references and discussions about outside content are permitted as long as they are legal under United States 
                        law. Wikis which focus on fetishes that are sexual in nature which involves minors are not allowed. This includes written, real images and animated/fictional material.</p>
                <h3>9.4. Promoting violence, hatred, or harassment against a person or group of people.</h3>
                    <p>This include wikis which promote violence or hatred against people or groups of people based on factors such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, disability, or other marginalized groups.</p>
                    <p>Derogatory language based on these factors is not allowed except when relevant to documenting an event, e.g. controversy about the inclusion of derogatory terms in a book.</p>
                <h3>9.5. Deceiving, defrauding, or misleading people</h3>
                    <p>Wikis which wilfully engage in deceiving, defrauding, or misleading people are prohibited.</p>
                    <p>Wikis are prohibited from engaging in disinformation, misrepresenting information purposefully to deceive and defraud, or from concealing their origin in order to mislead users on their intentions.</p>
                    <p>Wikis may not engage in impersonating any person or organisation. Misleading claims on health which have the potential to cause serious harm to people or public health are prohibited. 
                        This is not an exhaustive list of practices deemed deceptive but helps illustrate what sorts of behaviours are. Wikis which make it clear that their intention is not to deceive (which may include fantasy world, role-playing, etc.) 
                        would not fall into a violation of this policy.</p>
                <h3>9.6. Wikis which make it difficult for other wikis</h3>
                    <p>Things which have a tendency to draw unwelcome attention to HostForge, such as hate speech, routine denial of service attacks, excessively violent content, references to self-harm, or places in which illegal activity is discussed 
                        can create conditions that penalise other wikis, either in SEO, domain blacklisting, downtime, trust in HostForge, or excessive time usage of authorized personnel appointed by HostForge who are responsible for enforcing the 
                        Terms of Service and ensuring the proper functioning and compliance of the wikis hosted on the platform, especially in terms of policing content ("Staff").</p>
                    <p>HostForge reserves the right to terminate wikis which engage in any such behavior or make it difficult for us to host other wikis.</p>

        <h2>10. Global Conduct</h2>
        <p>When using our Services, we hope everyone works in a productive manner that furthers a wiki's purpose.</p>
        <p>To help ensure this, the following is prohibited:</p>
                <h3>10.1. Harassment</h3>
                    <p>Harassment of other users is unacceptable. In order for something to fall under this section, it usually requires a pattern of behavior rather than a single instance or event, but in some instances a single instance may be enough. 
                        Harassment defined in this policy includes those set forth below, but are not limited to:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Personal attacks, violence, threats of violence, or deliberate intimidation.</li>
                                <li>Offensive, derogatory, or discriminatory comments.</li>
                                <li>Gratuitous or off-topic use of sexual language or imagery.</li>
                                <li>Inappropriate or unwanted public or private communication, following, or any form of stalking.</li>
                                <li>Disclosure or threatening to disclose a person's identity or other private information without their consent. Disclosure of some identifying information is not consent to disclose other identifying information.</li>
                                <li>Inappropriate or unwanted publication of private communications. Publishing or reporting private communication or personally identifying information for the purposes of reporting harassment (as explained here) is acceptable.</li>
                                <li>Discrimination, particularly against marginalized and otherwise underrepresented groups. Targeted outreach to such groups is allowed and encouraged.</li>
                                <li>Reporting users for purposes other than reporting genuine violations of global policies (e.g., retaliating against a reporter or victim by filing a report claiming their response was harassment).</li>
                                <li>Repeated failures by wiki administration to handle harassment appropriately despite proper warnings by Staff may lead to intervention.</li>
                            </ul>
                <h3>10.2. Hate speech</h3>
                    <p>Hate speech is not allowed. Examples include but are not limited to using racist, homophobic or other derogatory language towards a person or group of people.</p>
                <h3>10.3 Personal threats.</h3>
                    <p>Personal threats are not allowed. Examples include but are not limited to death threats, threats of injury, threats of violence. This also may include threats that are below the legal threshold.</p>

        <h2>11. Links</h2>
            <p>HostForge has not reviewed all of the sites linked and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by HostForge. Use of any such linked web site is at the user's own risk.</p>

        <h2>12. Site Terms of Service Modifications</h2>
            <p>HostForge may revise these terms of service for its Services at any time without notice. By using this Web Site, you are agreeing to be bound by the then-current version of these Terms of Service.</p>

        <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>

            <p>Individuals or entities who are responsible for managing or are currently financing a specific wiki hosted on HostForge's platform ("Wiki Contacts") are responsible for upholding the Terms of Service and ensuring
